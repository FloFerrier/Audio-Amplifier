## Hardware
### 200W Discrete Power Amplifier
The Velleman Kit is ideal for active speaker system like guitar amplifier, home cinema systems
or HIFI system.
For making a stereo HIFI, you need two kits with two different transformers.
#### Specifications
* Full discrete design using Epitaxial Darlington transistors
* DC supply circuit on board with LED indication
* Comes complete with transistor isolators, spacers and bolts
* Overload and short circuit protection
#### Features
* 200W music power at 4 ohms load
* 100Wrms music power at 4 ohms load
* 70Wrms power at 8 ohms load
* Distortion : 0.02% at 1KHz/10W
* Frequency Response : 3Hz to 200KHz (-3dB)
* Sensitivity : 0.6Vrms
* Power Supply : 2 x 25-30Vac / 100 - 120VA

>Make sure to put a 1A T (slow-blow) fuse in series with the primary winding of the transformer.`
